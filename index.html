                        <p>
                            The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very thin (less than 1%) when compared to Earth and it has an
                            average
                            temperature of -62Â°C.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mars does have polar caps, minerals, and soil that could provide sources of carbon dioxide (CO2)
                            and
                            water to thicken the atmosphere. And some have suggested that there is enough CO2 locked away
                            in
                            Mars's ice and rocks to heat the planet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years a number of ideas have been proposed on how to
                            access these.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But in 2018, two NASA-funded scientists found that at best, accessible CO2 could
                            only
                            increase the surface temperature by less than 10Â°C. They came to the conclusion that processing all
                            these
                            sources found on Mars would also only increase the atmospheric pressure to 7%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They state, "even if enough CO2 were to be available, it would not be feasible to mobilise it; doing
                            so
                            would require processing a major fraction of the surface to release it into the atmosphere, which is
                            beyond
                            present-day technology".

                        <p>
                            Because life on Earth has evolved over the past 3.5 billion years in an unchanging
                            gravitational field, it shouldn't be a surprise that so much of our physiology
                            appears
                            to
                            be defined by -- or dependent upon -- gravity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At present, it is unknown what effects long-term exposure to this amount of gravity will have on the
                            human
                            body. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, ongoing research into the effects of microgravity on astronauts has shown that it has
                            a
                            detrimental effect on health, which includes loss of muscle mass, bone density, organ function, and
                            even
                            eyesight.

                        <p>
                            If we wanted to terraform Mars and change it's gravity, some suggest it would mean we would have to
                            change
                            the overall mass of the planet itself!

                            Earth's molten core creates a magnetic field surrounding our planet that helps to protect the
                            atmosphere
                            from the Sun. Harmful rays from the Sun are deflected by the magnetic field, so they don't hit the
                            atmosphere and damage it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Billions of years ago, Mars used to have a global magnetic field, but it shut down for reasons that
                            are
                            still unknown, about 4 billion years ago, leaving the atmosphere unshielded to radiation and causing
                            it
                            to bleed over time into space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, we can't just simply start it back up again. But one recent study suggests we could
                            create
                            an artificial one!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This study points out, if you want a good planetary magnetic field, what you really need is a strong
                            flow of charged particles around the planet. They argue, you can create a ring of charged particles
                            around Mars, by using its moon Phobos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Phobos is the larger of the two Martian moons, and it orbits the planet quite closely.  So, the team proposes using Phobos by ionizing particles
                            from
                            its surface, then accelerating them so they create a ring-shaped cloud of ions along the orbit of
                            Phobos. They argue that this could create a magnetic field strong enough to protect a terraformed
                            Mars.... watch this space!
